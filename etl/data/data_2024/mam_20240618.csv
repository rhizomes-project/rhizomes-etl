Two men behind bars. ""No Nos Queda Nada Que Perder Mas Que Nuestra Miseria"" written above them. One of the best-known artist-activists of the Chicano Movement (El Movimiento), Malaquías Montoya was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1938. He was raised by a single mother in a family of migrant workers who worked in the fields of central California. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps and attended the University of California at Berkeley, through the G.I. Bill. Montoya has taught at a number of universities, and has held a professorship at The University of California, Davis, since 1989. Montoya teaches both in the Department of Art, and the Department of Chicanx Studies. A painter and prolific silk screen artist, Montoya is famous for making artworks to support the United Farm Workers (UFW) and the struggle for labor rights to protect migrant farm workers. In 1968, Montoya founded the Mexican American Liberation Art Front in Sacramento. Later, in the early 1970s, he joined his brother Jose and other artists to form the Royal Chicano Air Force. Members painted murals addressing social justice, made banners and props for UFW marches, led poetry circles, and operated a bookstore. Malaquías Montoya also promoted a new awareness concerning the Pachuco and the Zoot Suit Riots, during which U.S. servicemen targeted and assaulted Pachucos wearing zoot suits in Los Angeles, June 3-8, 1943. Montoya combined political protest with Chicano art, developing a program of cultural resistance and political consciousness in the Chicano pueblo. Through his art, activism, and teaching, Montoya has inspired Chicanx people to demand equal opportunity in education and employment, and to resist societal discrimination by embracing their unique ethnic identity.",Political Border Activism Misery.

Tasked with establishing a colony in New Mexico after scouts saw the Gipuy (Kewa Pueblo) and Acoma people living stationary, agricultural based lives, Spanish conquistador Oñate (1550 – 1630) led his army, settlers, missionaries, and farm animals in 1598 through the challenging Chihuahuan Desert, searching for a passage to New Mexico. After four months, Oñate discovered the Rio Grande and established headquarters at El Paso del Norte. He organized a mass and ceremony, el toma, to claim the lands for Spain, celebrating their survival, and giving thanks to God. The mass and the feast are thought to be the first Thanksgiving ceremony in North America. Oñate marched through El Paso del Norte towards New Mexico, invading pueblos of the Gipuy (or Kewa Pueblo) along the way. Upon reaching the area of modern day Santa Fe, he briefly lived in peace with the Acoma people before his nephew, Juan de Zaldívar, led a coup against the Acoma People, pillaging food and prisoners in his wake. Zaldívar was killed in the struggle. Oñate retaliated in January of 1599 during what is known as the Acoma Massacre. An estimated 800-1,000 Acoma were murdered, while another 500 were punished through extreme mutilation, and sold into slavery. News of Oñate’s atrocities reached the Spanish crown, and King Phillip II banished Oñate from New Mexico, and Mexico. José Cisneros (1910-2009) has been described as a leading historical illustrator of the Southwest. While he was a painter, wood carver, writer and muralist, his primary focus was recording the history of the Southwest border region through his illustrations. Born in Villa Ocampo, Mexico, José eventually moved to Juarez with his family in 1925 where he obtained a school passport to attend the Lydia Patterson Institute in El Paso, Texas. While enrolled in a painting class, he discovered during one of the lessons that he was color blind. Two years later, he was forced to quit school to help financially support his family. He procured a position at El Paso’s White House Department Store, where he designed displays and began to draw on Poster Board. He introduced himself to artist Tom Lea, which led to an invitation for Cisneros to exhibit his work at the El Paso Public Library in 1938. His work was so popular that his exhibit was extended for two weeks, and was eventually exhibited in Juarez. Later, he was invited to illustrate many books and printing projects through a long-term collaboration with Carl Hertzog, the famous typographer, book designer, and publisher. During this time, he designed the coat of arms for the city of Juarez, and eventually the seal for The University of Texas at El Paso. Among his many honors are the Americanism Award given to him by the Daughters of the American Revolution; he was knighted by Pope John Paul II in 1990, and was given the Order of Civil Merit by King Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1991. In 2001, he received the National Humanities Medal presented by President George W. Bush. José Cisneros remained a lifelong resident of El Paso, Texas up until his death on November 14, 2009.

""My formal art studies began at the Rufino Tamayo Plastic Arts Workshop in Oaxaca City while I was an assistant and student of the Lithography studio. In 2006, I enrolled to complete my Bachelor’s Degree in visual arts at”La Escuela de Bellas Artes/ Fine Arts School of Oaxaca where I studied under the guidance of prolific artists Shinzaburo Takeda and Raul Herrera. During this time I completed my education by taking workshops with artists such as Isis Rodriguez, Marietta Bernstorff, Inma Coll and Elvia Esparza. I was also an assistant in the print studios of Artist Demian Flores (Taller Grafica Actual) and Alejandro Santiago (Taller la Huella). In 2010 I moved to Riverside, California and started getting involved in printmaking projects with a social justice and educational awareness in communities of color throughout California. In 2015, I opened my printmaking studio by collaboration with “The Desert Triangle Print Carpeta” located provisionally in Riverside. In 2017, I was commissioned by the Wignall Contemporary Art Museum to elaborate a permanent mural, which is located in Southern California.

The artist depicts the glaring economic inequality between the “haves” and the “have nots.” Here, Delgado references gluttony, one of the seven deadly sins in Christian religion, representing an excessive and ongoing eating of food or drink. Temperance cures gluttony, by encouraging persons to be healthy and to serve others. The richman consumes a turkey, (Meleagris gallopavo), a species that is native only to the Americas. In the 1500s, Spanish traders brought some that had been domesticated by Original Peoples to Europe and Asia. Today, the turkey is an important part of the Thanksgiving celebration. Francisco Delgado was born on November 3, 1974 in Ciudad Juárez, and grew up in El Paso’s Segundo Barrio. He received his Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Art. His Bordeño artworks are informed by the social and cultural struggles inherent to life on the Mexican and United States border. His artwork addresses issues of identity, race, cultural traditions, and government policies that affect migration and immigrants. In his own words, Delgado says “I am a visual artist with an artistic focus on social issues.” He visually represents the history of his community and creates a dialogue for social change. Often using dark humor or satire to depict his narratives, his artwork highlights the struggles of underrepresented people along the border. A prolific artist, Delgado works in painting, drawing, printmaking, and has also produced community murals. His works have been published in books, exhibited in national and international art exhibitions, and community institutions. Francisco currently resides, teaches and creates artwork in El Paso.

Born near the Mexico – U.S. border in Elsa, Texas to migrant farm workers, he was partially blinded as an infant and unable to work in the fields. Instead, Jordan decided to be a musician after hearing conjunto musician Valerio Longoria playing for the migrant farm workers in their camps. Because he wore a patch over his bad eye, he was called “El Parche.” A talented musician, he played 35 different instruments. Jordan experimented with electronic devices to enhance his sound, and was nicknamed the “Jimi Hendrix of the accordion”. He received numerous awards and provided music for Hollywood movies. Jiménez used a dynamic overhead perspective to emphasize the energy that Jordan generated on stage when making music. In Jiménez’s portrait, viewers see the musical notes flowing from Jordan’s accordion, and can almost hear his trademark sound. A man with an eye patch playing the accordion. other # : 9/40.

In I am Joaquin, Joaquin (the narrator of the poem) speaks of the struggles that the Chicano people have endured to gain economic justice and equal rights in the U.S, as well as to find an identity of being part of a unique Chicano culture. He promises that his culture will survive, if all Chicano people unify and demand social justice. The poet Gonzales outlines 2000 years of Mexican and Chicano history; he traces both his ancestry to the Spanish conquistadors and the Aztecs they ""conquered.” He also identifies with revolutionary figures of Mexican history, such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Benito Juárez, Pancho Villa, and Joaquin Murrieta who was a legendary Californian vaquero and gold miner known for seeking retribution against the Anglo-Americans invaders who hanged his brother and killed his wife. Joaquin Murrieta eventually was captured by a bounty hunter and beheaded. Known as the “Robin Hood of the West,” Murrieta later inspired the creation of the Cisco Kid and Zorro. In 1969, the poem was adapted into a short film by Luis Valdez, a leading figure in Chicano theater and film.

The car is a product of the industrialized machine age, which provides a mode of transportation and is a status symbol. Here, a blond haired woman lies in an embrace with a sports car, a luxury for most Americans. He references Greek mythology in the legend of Leda and the Swan ? the wife of a king seduced by Zeus in the guise of a swan. Jiménez also interprets the story of the Olmec were-jaguar, born from the union of a jaguar and woman. Associated with the Pop Art movement in his early career, the artist produced a fiberglass sculpture of the same name in 1969 to speak to Americans and their intense obsession with their cars.

José Cisneros (1910-2009) has been described as a leading historical illustrator of the Southwest. While he was a painter, wood carver, writer and muralist, his primary focus was recording the history of the Southwest border region through his illustrations. Born in Villa Ocampo, Mexico, José eventually moved to Juarez with his family in 1925 where he obtained a school passport to attend the Lydia Patterson Institute in El Paso, Texas. While enrolled in a painting class, he discovered during one of the lessons that he was color blind. Two years later, he was forced to quit school to help financially support his family. He procured a position at El Paso’s White House Department Store, where he designed displays and began to draw on Poster Board. He introduced himself to artist Tom Lea, which led to an invitation for Cisneros to exhibit his work at the El Paso Public Library in 1938. His work was so popular that his exhibit was extended for two weeks, and was eventually exhibited in Juarez. Later, he was invited to illustrate many books and printing projects through a long-term collaboration with Carl Hertzog, the famous typographer, book designer, and publisher. During this time, he designed the coat of arms for the city of Juarez, and eventually the seal for The University of Texas at El Paso. Among his many honors are the Americanism Award given to him by the Daughters of the American Revolution; he was knighted by Pope John Paul II in 1990, and was given the Order of Civil Merit by King Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1991. In 2001, he received the National Humanities Medal presented by President George W. Bush. Jose Cisneros remained a lifelong resident of El Paso, Texas up until his death on November 14, 2009.

Francisco Delgado was born on November 3, 1974 in Ciudad Juárez, and grew up in El Paso’s Segundo Barrio. He received his Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Art. His Bordeño artworks are informed by the social and cultural struggles inherent to life on the Mexican and United States border. His artwork addresses issues of identity, race, cultural traditions, and government policies that affect migration and immigrants. In his own words, Delgado says “I am a visual artist with an artistic focus on social issues”. He visually represents the history of his community and creates a dialogue for social change. Often using dark humor or satire to depict his narratives, his artwork highlights the struggles of underrepresented people along the border. A prolific artist, Delgado works in painting, drawing, printmaking, and has also produced community murals. His works have been published in books, exhibited in national and international art exhibitions and community institutions. Francisco currently resides, teaches and creates artwork in El Paso.

He was raised by a single mother in a family of migrant workers who worked in the fields of central California. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps and later attended The University of California at Berkeley, through the G.I. Bill. Montoya has taught at a number of universities, and held a professorship at The University of California, Davis since 1989. He teaches both in the Department of Art, and the Department of Chicanx Studies. A painter and prolific silk screen artist, Montoya is famous for making artworks that support the United Farm Workers (UFW) and the struggle for labor rights to protect migrant farm workers. In 1968, Montoya founded the Mexican American Liberation Art Front in Sacramento. Later, in 1970, he joined his brother José and other artists to form the Royal Chicano Air Force. Members painted murals addressing social justice, made banners and props for UFW marches, led poetry circles, and operated a bookstore. He also promoted a new awareness concerning the pachuco (Chicano hipster-rebel) and the Zoot Suit Riots, during which U.S. servicemen targeted and assaulted pachucos wearing zoot suits in Los Angeles, June 3-8, 1943. Montoya combined political protest with Chicano art, developing a program of cultural consciousness and political resistance in the Chicano pueblo. Through his art, activism, and teaching, Montoya calls for equal opportunity in education and employment for Chicanos, and encourages them to embrace their unique ethnic identity.

Hoping to achieve the American Dream, immigrants journey from Mexico, and increasingly from the Northern Triangle in Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Individuals and families endure violence and hardship to come to the U.S., demonstrating grit, perseverance, and ingenuity to survive the known and unknown perils of crossing to the other side of the border (el otro lado). Once in the U.S., immigrants are vulnerable to abuse and discrimination while trying to adapt to a diffferent culture. The artist’s title appropriately describes the scene, immigrants far from their homeland and their spiritual life, and so close to the U.S., where they may face more obstacles. On the left side, a vehicle belonging to the U.S. border patrol chases a group of immigrants confronted by cacti and barbed wire. A federal helicopter flies overhead, while a woman’s lifeless body lies on the ground, her disheveled clothing indicates a nefarious end. Near the center, with a coyote nipping at her legs, a woman frantically tries to escape. Next to her, a father and mother cautiously lead their children into the U.S. On the right side, a smuggler armed with rifle and pistol supervises his pack of mulas (“mules”) carrying heavy bundles, meanwhile an airplane drops more bundles of contraband below. Jiménez captures the harsh and cruel reality of border crossings facing immigrants. Proud of his Chicano roots, Luis Jiménez (1940-2006) was an El Paso, Texas native, best known for his large-scale, brightly colored sculptures immersed in the Chicano iconography of Texas and New Mexico. Jiménez studied art and architecture at The University of Texas in Austin and El Paso. He eventually traveled to Mexico to study the famous Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, and was also influenced by regionalists Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood. After completing school, he went to work for his father making neon signs and car decals. In 1966 Jiménez moved to New York and joined the Pop Art scene, making painted fiberglass figurative works inspired by the everyday lives of Latinos living in the Southwest. His work shows his concern for working-class people and those who have suffered from discrimination.

The warrior Popocatépetl was sent to battle by his king, who wanted to discourage the romance between his daughter Princess Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl. Although the king had promised Popo his daughter’s hand in marriage, he hoped that Popo would die in battle, so he lied to his daughter that her lover was dead. Izta died of a broken heart. When Popo returned to find her dead, he knelt down to hold her lifeless body. The gods took pity on the two lovers and covered them with snow. The story describes the origin of the volcanoes Popocatépetl (“the Smoking Mountain”) and Iztaccíhuatl (“White Woman” in Nahuatl, sometimes called the “Mujer Dormida’’ or “Sleeping Woman” in Spanish). Volcanoes are the home of the gods and considered sacred in Mexico. In the title of the print, air, earth, fire, and water reference the original elements in nature.

In the work, a mature looking couple dance the Texas Waltz, a contemporary style of the traditional waltz. The waltz originated in Europe in the 1700s, and was considered provocative as couples held each other closely as they danced. Here, a man waltzes with his partner, who embraces him tightly. The artist used energetic lines to denote action, and a bold red color in the woman’s top to indicate passion. The artist in other works depicted traditional Mexican dance, as in The Fiesta Jarabe sculpture, of which there exists five versions. His Fiesta sculpture represents the Mexican jarabe folk dance, often called the Mexican hat dance. One of his Fiesta Jarabe sculptures can be found at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry near San Diego, California. The sculpture was purchased by the U.S. federal government and erected in 1991. Describing the sculpture at Otay Mesa, Jiménez said, “It is a project that I thought of as a kind of bridge. I grew up on the border. I saw [immigrant] families crossing. My father was [an undocumented immgrant] from the time he was nine until I was born, when he was twenty-five. I decided that’s what I would focus on, and I’ll title it Fiesta, and people on both sides of the border will be able to relate to it.”",Border Dance Movement Luis Jimenez. Color lithograph.

Despite the rocks and cacti obstructing his passage, a young man wearing only shorts and Nike shoes plows his Radio Flyer tricycle forward. Oddly, the tricycle rider is headless, and his face is on his stomach. According to the artist, his imagery was inspired by the Brazilian poet Oswald de Andrade’s 1928 Manifesto Antropófago (Anthropophagist Manifesto). Its argument is that colonized countries, such as Brazil, should ingest the culture of the colonizer and digest it in its own way. Delgado refers to this “cultural cannibalism” to explain how “Chicanos ingest American culture, and we make it our own.” The artist combines this cannibal concept with the Blemmyae, headless human figures with faces on their torsos, as found in Greek and Roman mythology and medieval art. Francisco Delgado was born on November 3, 1974 in Ciudad Juárez, and grew up in El Paso’s Segundo Barrio. He received his Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Art. His Bordeño artworks are informed by the social and cultural struggles inherent to life on the Mexican and United States border. His artwork addresses issues of identity, race, cultural traditions, and government policies that affect migration and immigrants. In his own words, Delgado says “I am a visual artist with an artistic focus on social issues”. He visually represents the history of his community and creates a dialogue for social change. Often using dark humor or satire to depict his narratives, his artwork highlights the struggles of underrepresented people along the border. A prolific artist, Delgado works in painting, drawing, printmaking, and has also produced community murals. His works have been published in books, exhibited in national and international art exhibitions and community institutions. Francisco currently resides, teaches, and creates artwork in El Paso.

He was raised by his mother and her family in Laredo, because his father died when he was less than one year old. While studying art at Texas A&I College, and later Texas A&I University (renamed Texas A & M University, Kingsville), he became marginally involved in the Chicano Movement for civil rights. Eventually, he became an historical figure in the Chicano art movement. His colorful portraits represent real people from his life, many of them based on photographs. According to Martínez, “I’ve never really done art that I would say is political. But I think the kind of art that becomes politicized, as in my case and in many of my contemporaries, is simply because it had a Chicano perspective or Chicano imagery. The Chicano Movement was a renaissance in thinking about us and in creating those institutions and images and writings that reflected who we are. They were non-existent at that time, we had nothing to relate to, so we had to make it up as we went along. And that was the road to a deeper understanding of who we are.

2020.2.4.10,Carnal,,Francisco Delgado,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_676/008/20202410-2.jpg,,"Francisco Delgado Brother/Carnal, 1997 Oil on wood panel, 48” x 36” Mexic-Arte Museum Collection 2020.2.4.10 Gift of Juan Antonio Sandoval Jr. El Paso artist Francisco Delgado references the Christian saint and martyr St. Sebastian (AD 256 – 288) who was bound to a tree or post and shot with arrows by Roman soldiers after he refused to deny his faith, as ordered by Emperor Diocletian. Rescued and healed by St. Irene, St. Sebastian later was clubbed to death by the Romans. Inspired by Renaissance paintings honoring this saint, Delgado pays homage to Mexican and Chicano hipsters, pachucos, who were attacked by U.S. servicemen and arrested during the Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles, June 3 – 8, 1943. The history of the zoot suit is complex. Pachucos wore zoot suits prior to and during World War II, but they did not invent them, nor did they wear them exclusively. Zoot suits were first worn by African American jazz musicians that toured around the country. Jazz aficionados popularized them by wearing them to dances, and they grew widespread from there. In Los Angeles, they were worn by African Americans, Mexican Americans, Japanese Americans, and ethnic whites including Italian Americans and Jewish Americans, among others. Francisco Delgado was born on November 3, 1974 in Ciudad Juárez, and grew up in El Paso’s Segundo Barrio. He received his Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Art. His Bordeño artworks are informed by the social and cultural struggles inherent to life on the Mexican and United States border. His artwork addresses issues of identity, race, cultural traditions, and government policies that affect migration and immigrants. In his own words, Delgado says “I am a visual artist with an artistic focus on social issues”. He visually represents the history of his community and creates a dialogue for social change. Often using dark humor or satire to depict his narratives, his artwork highlights the struggles of underrepresented people along the border. A prolific artist, Delgado works in painting, drawing, printmaking, and has also produced community murals. His works have been published in books, exhibited in national and international art exhibitions and community institutions. Francisco currently resides, teaches, and creates artwork in El Paso.

2020.2.156.31,Howl,,Luis Jiménez,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_676/008/2020215631.jpg,,"Luis Jiménez Howl, 1977 Color lithograph on paper, 44.5"" x 34"" Mexic-Arte Museum Collection 2020.2.156.31 Gift of Juan Antonio Sandoval Jr. Howl by Luis Jiménez portrays a lone wolf howling at the full moon that rises above snow capped mountains. The wolf’s howl is transformed into the title of the work. Wolves, like this Mexican wolf, communicate with their pack by howling; this vocalization communicates their location and marks their territory; serves as a warning to rivals or signals a threat of intruders. Besides expressing affection through their howling, wolves express other emotions. Here, the “howl” vibrates above, resonating with rage, pain, and warning. Jiménez used the color red to emphasize these strong emotions. Note that the letter “l” in the word “howl” resembles the wolf’s raised right paw. The wolf is enraged as his species is endangered. Humans continue to hunt wolves for pelts and bounty. The wolf also painfully mourns the vanishing Western landscape and the diminishing presence of the Original Americans. The howl is a warning to humanity to protect and preserve the natural landscape and animal life. The Mexican wolf also symbolizes how Mexican immigrants have been hunted by the border patrol and vigilantes at border crossings. This work is a visual metaphor for the artist Jiménez, who for years before he gained critical recognition was perceived as an outsider: a “lone wolf.” Born in El Paso, he was an artist fiercely proud of his Mexican roots who celebrated the everyday culture of the Southwest. He howled especially for his people, Mexicans and Chicanos, and their ongoing struggle for social mobility and social justice in the borderland and beyond. Proud of his Chicano roots, Luis Jiménez (1940-2006) was an El Paso, Texas native, best known for his large-scale, brightly colored sculptures immersed in the Chicano iconography of Texas and New Mexico. Jiménez studied art and architecture at The University of Texas in Austin and El Paso. He eventually traveled to Mexico to study the famous Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, and was also influenced by regionalists Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood. After completing school, he went to work for his father making neon signs and car decals. In 1966 Jiménez moved to New York and joined the Pop Art scene, making painted fiberglass figurative works inspired by the everyday lives of Latinos living in the Southwest. His work shows his concern for working-class people and those who have suffered from discrimination. Jimenez was and remains respected in Latino communities for his perspective and narrative of the culture of Mexico and the Southwest. His artwork emulates popular Cholo car culture, demonstrated in his use of fiberglass, spray paint, and imagery consisting of Aztec emperors, border crossing, and vaqueros riding wild broncos. His works are in the collections of the Albuquerque Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., the El Paso Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, among others.",Border Fauna Wolf Environment Nature Luis Jimenez.

Born in Villa Ocampo, Mexico, Jose eventually moved to Juarez with his family in 1925 where he obtained a school passport to attend the Lydia Patterson Institute in El Paso, Texas. While enrolled in a painting class, he discovered during one of the lessons that he was color blind. Two years later, he was forced to quit school to help financially support his family. He procured a position at El Paso’s White House Department Store, where he designed displays and began to draw on Poster Board. He introduced himself to artist Tom Lea, which led to an invitation for Cisneros to exhibit his work at the El Paso Public Library in 1938. His work was so popular that his exhibit was extended for two weeks, and was eventually exhibited in Juarez. Later, he was invited to illustrate many books and printing projects through a long-term collaboration with Carl Hertzog, the famous typographer, book designer, and publisher. During this time, he designed the coat of arms for the city of Juarez, and eventually the seal for The University of Texas at El Paso. Among his many honors are the Americanism Award given to him by the Daughters of the American Revolution; he was knighted by Pope John Paul II in 1990, and was given the Order of Civil Merit by King Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1991.

Here, she presents two women fighting in the center of this print. We have no idea why the two rivals are brawling in front of the El Rio bar. On either side of the two women, onlookers watch the fight. Looking through the port windows of the front door, a man and woman observe the combatants with curiosity. Symbolizing anger and treachery, a small black dog barks at the women, while a full moon floats in the dark sky. The artist stimulates our imagination, so that we can complete our own version of her story. A narrative artist, Carmen Lomas Garza is a skillful storyteller who specializes in relating to her Mexican American heritage. Carmen Lomas Garza is an award winning artist-educator, who was born in Kingsville, Texas in 1948. She attended Texas A & I University (renamed Texas A & M University, Kingsville), Juarez-Lincoln/Antioch Graduate School, and San Francisco State University. The artist is known for her use of papel picado in large ofrendas. She describes her life as an artist: “At the age of thirteen, I decided to become a visual artist and pursue every opportunity to advance my knowledge of art in institutions of higher education. The Chicano Movement of the late 1960s inspired the dedication of my creativity to the depiction of special and everyday events in the lives of Mexican Americans based on my memories and experiences in South Texas. I saw the need to create images that would elicit recognition and appreciation among Mexican Americans, both adults and children, while at the same time serve as a source of education for others not familiar with our culture. It has been my objective since 1969 to make paintings, prints, installations for Day of the Dead, paper and metal cutouts that instill pride in our history and culture in American society.” Two women fighting and pulling each others hair outside of a dance club while a group of people look on",Border Fight Bar Club Carmen Lomas Garza.

Within the Chicano culture, old classic cars are not just instruments for mobility but are re-fashioned machines with sensory and aesthetic appeal and are objects of art. Both my grandfather and my father had a handsome old classic car. My son continues the tradition with his refurbished 1965 Mustang. I saw this 1936 Ford at a restaurant and fell in love with it and asked the owner permission to photograph it. I wondered about what travels this handsome car had taken and what stories it could tell. I wanted the painting to have a feeling of an endless clear sky on a warm summer day, like driving on a never-ending highway. This award-winning painting was on exhibition at the Americana Museum when Juan Sandoval first saw it. He immediately was attracted to it and decided to purchase it because it reminded him of his childhood. He never owned a car, preferring to use his money to purchase art; so he stated that this painting would be his car if anyone ever asked him if he owned one. My 1936 Ford was reproduced in Hecho en Tejas. ""I am inspired by the rich Hispanic culture, and through it I hope to encourage a greater understanding and appreciation of the Hispanic culture.

As a child, I would remember crossing the bridge from El Paso to Juárez and watching people cross the river in makeshift inner-tube rafts. People with jobs in the U.S. side and who didn’t want to get wet would pay “lancheros” to ferry them across the river every day. I see this as the universal experiences; we all have people who cross boundaries and blaze paths to reach our goals, whatever they may be. For years, political graffiti has been painted on the concrete banks of the border. I decided to use “Esto No Es Una Frontera/ Esto es un Río” as one of many messages painted on the concrete banks for years. The quote is from [“The Liberator” of Venezuela] Simón Bolívar, who alluded to the use of borders to divide communities instead of uniting them. Bolívar suggested that the overreaching powers in place politically at the time benefitted from the ensuing chaos that occurred once divisions were made and enforced. He further suggested that if one community suffered, the other “opposite” community suffered, as well. Another graffiti tag appears on one of pillars that support the international bridge. The message was painted by the family of Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, who was shot and killed by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent through a barbed wire border fence near El Paso, Texas. At the time of the shooting, Guereca, a 15-year-old-Mexican national, was standing on the Mexican side of the Mexico-United States border, while the agent was on the American side.

The animal portraits were done on old Sonidero Party posters found on the streets of Canutillo, TX. The title is inspired by the song Mis Tres Animales by Mexican norteño band, Los Tucanes De Tijuana, who describe the song as one of their “valientes crónicas del acontecer diario” or “brave chronicles of everyday life.” The song is a first person narrative where a drug dealer uses animals to metaphorically speak about the products he sells in the U.S. In both song and the print, El Gallo symbolizes a marijuana cigarette and along with the other animals is used to describe the narco culture and its impact on everyday life. For the artists, it also represents the human factor involved in transforming an animal and a plant as complex symbols of social behavior; this is why the rooster has a human eye. Los Dos is the collaboration moniker of husband and wife duo Ramon and Christian Cárdenas. Ramon is a Filipino-American visual artist and co-founder of Maintain, a multimedia artist network formed in 2007 and involved in curating cultural art events and projects in El Paso. Christian is a female mixed media artist from Cd. Juárez, Chihuahua, with a background in textiles, design, and printmaking.

Romero Freeway Wars, 1990 Serigraph on paper, 39.75” x 46” Mexic-Arte Museum Collection 2020.2.286.1 Gift of Juan Antonio Sandoval Jr. Chicano artist Frank Romero has explored numerous subjects in his art, especially the car culture of Los Angeles. He portrays classic cars, trucks, lowriders, and muscle cars. Romero is also known for depicting car crashes on freeways and shootings from cars, as seen in this print Freeway Wars. Rivals shoot at each other from their cars, while speeding recklessly around a curve in the freeway. Frank Romero was born in 1941 in East Los Angeles, California; he attended Otis College of Art and California State University. Romero began painting when he was five years old. During the height of the Chicano Movement for civil rights in the early 1970s, Romero identified himself as a Chicano. He began working with three other Chicano artists in what was known as Los Four. The art collective used murals, graffiti, and street theater to protest America?’s military involvement in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. His most famous artwork, The Death of Rubén Salazar (1986), documents the killing of Chicano journalist Rubén Salazar. He was fatally struck by a canister of tear gas shot into the Silver Dollar Bar on August 29, 1970 by LA County Sheriffs after a rally against the Vietnam War. “I grew up in East Los Angeles, and we always had problems and feared the sheriff’s department because their policy was to come down hard on minorities,” says Romero. Commenting on his use of bright, bold colors in his art, “The part of me that’s Mexican or Latino, I think of Mexicans, like hot vibrant colors. You see that in the way the houses are painted in Mexico and East LA.” Romero has been a dedicated member of the Chicano art community of Los Angeles for forty years.",Border Guns Violence Los Angeles Automobile.

2020.2.4.13,26,,Francisco Delgado,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_676/008/20202413.jpg,,"Francisco Delgado $26, 1998 Oil on canvas, 49.5” x 87.75” Mexic-Arte Museum Collection 2020.2.4.13 Gift of Juan Antonio Sandoval Jr. As a borderland artist, Francisco Delgado illustrates U.S. citizens crossing the border into Mexico. Tourists, workers, students, commercial and industrial travelers pass through the busy El Paso – Juárez, Mexico border, which also conveys to-and-fro international trade between Mexico and the United States. According to Delgado, his painting represents the crossing of currency from the U.S. to Mexico, where the U.S. dollar is valued for its purchasing power (currently one dollar is worth about 19 pesos). This scene takes place at the “Free Bridge” (Cordova Bridge or the Bridge of the Americas) in El Paso as drivers cross into Juárez. U.S. Presidents Andrew Jackson (left), Abraham Lincoln (center), and George Washington (right) drive individually into Mexico, each of them pictured on U.S. dollar bills. Together, the total worth of their currency adds up to $26 (Jackson $20, Lincoln $5, and Washington $1). Jackson appears to be yelling, perhaps at the newspaper vendor who runs toward him. An angry Lincoln is saying “no” to a window washer, who wipes down his windshield and asks to be paid. He holds up an empty Coke bottle to Lincoln, who refuses to drop money into it. Meanwhile, a woman, wearing a green shawl (symbolizing the color of money) and holding a cup from McDonald’s, begs Lincoln for money. Her little boy reaches for his milk bottle that she clutches in her left hand. Washington waits patiently for the traffic to move forward. A paleta (Mexican popsicle) vendor pushes his paleta wagon, hoping to sell to the Americans. Delgado explains, “The masks on the vendors and other Mexicans symbolize the struggle to survive. They are luchadores [Mexican wrestlers]. The masks are black because they are anonymous, and we do not see them. We don’t see or acknowledge their faces or struggle.” Francisco Delgado was born on November 3, 1974 in Ciudad Juárez, and grew up in El Paso’s Segundo Barrio. He received his Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Art. His Bordeño artworks are informed by the social and cultural struggles inherent to life on the Mexican and United States border. His artwork addresses issues of identity, race, cultural traditions, and government policies that affect migration and immigrants. In his own words, Delgado says “I am a visual artist with an artistic focus on social issues”. He visually represents the history of his community and creates a dialogue for social change. Often using dark humor or satire to depict his narratives, his artwork highlights the struggles of underrepresented people along the border. A prolific artist, Delgado works in painting, drawing, printmaking, and has also produced community murals. His works have been published in books, exhibited in national and international art exhibitions and community institutions. Francisco currently resides, teaches and creates artwork in El Paso.

Lithograph on paper, 31” x 22.5” Mexic-Arte Museum Collection 2020.2.156.34 Gift of Juan Antonio Sandoval Jr. Chicano artist Luis Jiménez created a portrait of famous Chicano activist César Estrada Chávez (1927 – 1993), an iconic figure in the American civil rights movement. Jiménez captured Chávez’s humble nature, his gritty determination, and silent power; his lips parted, he appears to be speaking directly to the viewer. Chávez organized protest marches to demand labor rights for Mexican and Chicano migrant farm workers. Along with Dolores Huerta, he organized the United Farm Workers (UFW) in 1962, the first Mexican American labor group to be recognized by the AFL-CIO (The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations). To garner support from American consumers, Chávez mounted a nation-wide boycott of iceberg lettuce and grapes. A pacifist inspired by Gandhi, Chávez practiced nonviolent resistance in his protests, and he fasted to gain public sympathy for the UFW and its fight for labor rights. His protests and speeches inflamed growers, and he received countless death threats. His constant fasting vigils may have weakened his health, and he died of natural causes. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, where he was called an American hero-martyr. César Chávez Day (March 31, his birthday) is a U.S. federal commemorative holiday, as proclaimed by President Barack Obama in 2014. Proud of his Chicano roots, Luis Jiménez (1940-2006) was an El Paso, Texas native, best known for his large-scale, brightly colored sculptures immersed in the Chicano iconography of Texas and New Mexico. Jiménez studied art and architecture at The University of Texas in Austin and El Paso. He eventually traveled to Mexico to study the famous Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, and was also influenced by regionalists Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood. After completing school, he went to work for his father making neon signs and car decals. In 1966 Jiménez moved to New York and joined the Pop Art scene, making painted fiberglass figurative works inspired by the everyday lives of Latinos living in the Southwest. His work shows his concern for working-class people and those who have suffered from discrimination. Jimenez was and remains respected in Latino communities for his perspective and narrative of the culture of Mexico and the Southwest. His artwork emulates popular Cholo car culture, demonstrated in his use of fiberglass, spray paint, and imagery consisting of Aztec emperors, border crossing, and vaqueros riding wild broncos. His works are in the collections of the Albuquerque Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., the El Paso Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, among others.",César Chávez Border Activism Political Agriculture United Farm Workers Luis Jimenez.

Due to my personal history as an immigrant, the recurring theme in my work responds to and communicates relevant political and personal impressions, such as the right for immigrants to have a path to American citizenship. My work is an exploration of immigration/migration and its effects on culture, family, the loss of los ausentes (the ones who left their homelands and are considered missing in their physical absence, but not in their psychological presence,) and the individual in these times of racism. I also represent with images the timeless human phenomena of deconstructing female stereotypes, echoing themes of divided families, struggle, strength, and success.

The still photograph has been featured in several art exhibitions in the photography form. My friend, Karl Whiataker, asked to use the image for a print created by maestro Arturo Negrete and his team at Mexico City’s Taller 75 Grados. The print features Luis (Tego), a young Chicano bicycle enthusiast proudly resting on his beautiful blue and chrome, three-wheel custom lowrider bike in the midst of Lincoln Park, an urban jungle playground of grass and freeway concrete pillars adorned with colorful art murals with Mexican American themes. The area has become a center of the celebration of Chicano culture, art, and heritage with its Chicano-themed murals and events like the annual Lincoln Park Day, featuring lowriders cars and bicycles, art, music, dance, and attire. It is El Paso’s flavor of San Diego’s famous Chicano Park. Lincoln Center and Park are located under several feeder arteries in the I-10/54 “Spaghetti Bowl'' freeway exchange area, historically known as Concordia and Saipan. Lincoln Center, the last remaining structure from El Paso’s past, was a training camp for Buffalo Soldiers (1860’s) and the first non-segregated school, admitting Mexican American and Black students (1915). The summer when I took the photograph of Luis, the issue of Lincoln Center’s future had reached a fevered pitch, involving the Texas Department of Transportation, El Paso City Council, multiple car clubs, and several grassroots neighborhood groups, like Save Lincoln Center and Lincoln Park Conservation Committee. El Paso is my home base to wander the US/Mexico border.

José Cisneros (1910-2009) has been described as a leading historical illustrator of the Southwest. While he was a painter, wood carver, writer and muralist, his primary focus was recording the history of the Southwest border region through his illustrations. Born in Villa Ocampo, Mexico, José eventually moved to Juarez with his family in 1925 where he obtained a school passport to attend the Lydia Patterson Institute in El Paso, Texas. While enrolled in a painting class, he discovered during one of the lessons that he was color blind. Two years later, he was forced to quit school to help financially support his family. He procured a position at El Paso’s White House Department Store, where he designed displays and began to draw on Poster Board. He introduced himself to artist Tom Lea, which led to an invitation for Cisneros to exhibit his work at the El Paso Public Library in 1938. His work was so popular that his exhibit was extended for two weeks, and was eventually exhibited in Juarez. Later, he was invited to illustrate many books and printing projects through a long-term collaboration with Carl Hertzog, the famous typographer, book designer, and publisher. During this time, he designed the coat of arms for the city of Juarez, and eventually the seal for The University of Texas at El Paso. Among his many honors are the Americanism Award given to him by the Daughters of the American Revolution; he was knighted by Pope John Paul II in 1990, and was given the Order of Civil Merit by King Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1991.

Other curing rituals helped to heal tribal members and protect their animals. Here, the shaman wearing a red shirt holds an offering, while behind him the drummer makes music and dances. The Rarámuri once occupied large areas in the Chihuahuan Desert, but were driven south by the Spanish settlers looking for precious metals. Primarily farmers, the Rarámuri lived on small farming settlements or “ranchos.” Their original name, Rarámuri, refers to their ability to run long distances. They were never fully assimilated, although many blend Catholic practices with their native religion. Today, their population numbers around 70,000, and they remain fiercely independent. Artist Marta Arat (1932-2002) was born in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. She spent most of her adult life along the El Paso/Juarez border, where she studied art at The University of Texas at El Paso. Arat painted her social and spiritual self and created work that experimented with color while mirroring a time and place that reflects the region of the Chihuahuan borderlands. Arat’s work presents images taken from the beauty and diversity of people’s hopes, aspirations, and dreams. Marta Arat painted a full spectrum of women, with the belief that women along the US/Mexico border are often overlooked though they are a historic example of life and change. She was a close friend of the El Paso collector Juan Sandoval. Arat was active in the Soñando Juntos organization, an immigrant youth-led organization that empowers borderland immigrant youth through civic engagement. Locally, her first exhibition ""Life in the Barranca Del Cobre"" in 1980 was followed by her first group exhibition ""La Mujer y Su Arte"" in 1984. Arat’s artwork has been published in magazines, books, and commercially.

Arat was active in the Soñando Juntos organization, an immigrant youth-led organization that empowers borderland immigrant youth through civic engagement. Locally, her first exhibition ""Life in the Barranca Del Cobre"" in 1980 was followed by her first group exhibition ""La Mujer y Su Arte"" in 1984. Arat’s artwork has been published in magazines, books, and commercially. From Chihuahua, Mexico throughout Texas and to other parts of the region, she has exhibited in museums, galleries and university libraries. Her paintings can be found in many private, corporate, and public museum collections throughout Mexico and the United States.",Border Indigenous Tarahumara Marta Arat. Graphite.

Oñate was one of the few that received the title of adelantado. Adelantado was a title granted to a person in command of an expedition. Adelantado Don Juan de Oñate was born into a mining and military family in 1550 at Zacatecas, México. Because of his family’s prestige and military service, he was chosen to lead the expedition into New Mexico. Arriving in El Paso del Norte, with over five hundred colonists from Zacatecas and Mexico City, Oñate took possession of New Mexico on April 30, 1958. From here the expedition traveled pass the Rio Grande into Northern New Mexico. Los personajes de los conquistadores y en particular el del adelantado Don Juan de Oñate han sido sujetos preferidos en los dibujos de José Cisneros. Oñate era uno de los pocos que recibieron el título de adelantado que era un título concedido a una persona dirigente de una expedición. El adelantado Don Juan de Oñate nació de una familia minera y militar en el año 1550 en Zacatecas, México. Debido al prestigio de su familia y a su servicio militar Oñate recibió el demando a conducir la expedición hacia Nuevo México. Al llegar a El Paso del Norte, con mas de quinientos colonos de Zacatecas y de la Ciudad de México, Oñate tomó posesión de Nuevo México el 30 de Abril de 1598. De El Paso del Norte la expedición continuó siguiendo el Río Grande hasta llegar al norte de Nuevo México. José Cisneros (1910-2009) has been described as a leading historical illustrator of the Southwest. While he was a painter, wood carver, writer and muralist, his primary focus was recording the history of the Southwest border region through his illustrations. Born in Villa Ocampo, Mexico, he eventually moved to Juárez with his family in 1925 where he obtained a school passport to attend the Lydia Patterson Institute in El Paso, Texas. While enrolled in a painting class, he discovered during one of the lessons that he was color blind. Two years later, he was forced to quit school to help financially support his family. He procured a position at El Paso’s White House Department Store, where he designed displays and began to draw on Poster Board. He introduced himself to artist Tom Lea, which led to an invitation for Cisneros to exhibit his work at the El Paso Public Library in 1938. His work was so popular that his exhibit was extended for two weeks, and was eventually exhibited in Juárez. Later, he was invited to illustrate many books and printing projects through a long-term collaboration with Carl Hertzog, the typographer, book designer, and publisher. During this time, he designed the coat of arms for the city of Juárez, and eventually the seal for The University of Texas at El Paso. Among his many honors are the Americanism Award given to him by the Daughters of the American Revolution; he was knighted by Pope John Paul II in 1990, and was given the Order of Civil Merit by King Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1991. In 2001, he received the National Humanities Medal presented by President George W. Bush.

Jiménez studied art and architecture at The University of Texas in Austin and El Paso. He eventually traveled to Mexico to study the famous Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, and was also influenced by regionalists Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood. After completing school, he went to work for his father making neon signs and car decals. In 1966 Jiménez moved to New York and joined the Pop Art scene, making painted fiberglass figurative works inspired by the everyday lives of Latinos living in the Southwest. His work shows his concern for working-class people and those who have suffered from discrimination. Jimenez was and remains respected in Latino communities for his perspective and narrative of the culture of Mexico and the Southwest. His artwork emulates popular Cholo car culture, demonstrated in his use of fiberglass, spray paint, and imagery consisting of Aztec emperors, border crossing, and vaqueros riding wild broncos. His works are in the collections of the Albuquerque Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., the El Paso Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, among others.",Border Horse Animal Fauna Luis Jimenez.

While making this print, I was also working on a painting for an exhibit with the National Museum of Mexican Art about home and community. When I think of home, the image of the mountains comes to mind, so in this print, I depict the Franklin Mountains. These mountains are a sacred indigenous symbol of the thunderbird on them. As a kid, I played at the foot of these mountains, and they make me feel grounded. The image of a hummingbird is inspired by the Mexica (Aztec) tradition that says the spark in our hearts beats like the flight of a hummingbird: steady and self-sustaining. I was in some hard times, personally having lost important people in my life. I was feeling crazy and alone like a coyote howling at the rabbit moon. So I’m telling a love story through symbols and images about heartbreak and anxiety. But there is also some comedy in those wild eyes. Laughing at my loss. There is a saying I know from the work of the artist poet, Jose Montoya: “La locura cura” (Craziness cures). Laughter heals, and this print cracks me up. I was born in Las Cruces, NM [in 1983] and raised in El Paso, TX. I’ve exhibited in museums, galleries, and community spaces in Chicago, Los Angeles, and throughout the Southwestern region.

Our work tries to represent our opinion about this relation, and how we all forget the more simple things; like we all are just humans trying to live in this difficult world behind a fence as we wait for the next nonsense decision, rule, or law in this world. Meanwhile, we see so many hard things passing by through our eyes, people looking for money, fame, and so many things with no real meaning, and in that search we lose a very valuable moment in our lives. We don’t see the amazing simple things, while a dog pees on our shoe. Jellyfish Colectivo is a creative group who have worked with graphic art, murals, exhibitions, animatio, and with social art projects based in Juárez since 2010. This group has worked in many different projects, like workshops with young kids, people with some disabilities, or adolescents for three years (2010-2013), and our collective did big events in Juárez like Hola Color (2013) and Color Walk (2014). With our artwork, Jellyfish Collective has worked in places like Mexico City, New York, Austin, and Germany to name a few. We won our first animated short film award for the Best Animated Short Film of 2014 in FILM (Festival Internacional de Cine de Morelia). We are three graphic designers and one architect."" – Jellyfish Collective, Ciudad Juárez, Mexico",Border Desert Triangle Print Carpeta Art Collective Juarez. Serigraph.
